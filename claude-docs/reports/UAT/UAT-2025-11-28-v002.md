# USER ACCESSIBILITY TEST

**Report ID:** UAT-2025-11-28-v02
**Date:** 2025-11-28
**Agent:** ua-tester
**Type:** User Accessibility Test - Lovable Prototype User Journey & UI Behavior

## What I Tested

I tested the complete user booking journey on the Lovable prototype at https://openslotv1.lovable.app. The goal was to document how a user discovers services, sets their price, receives offers from providers, and completes a booking. This report captures the full UI behavior to serve as a reference for build-lead.

## What I Saw

### Screen 1: Home (Category Selection)

When I landed on the app, I saw a clean mint-green gradient background with the heading "What do you need today?" Below that, a 2x2 grid of service category cards appeared: Massage, Nails, Yoga, and Chiropractor. Each card has a circular icon and category name. The Massage card was pre-highlighted with a green border and showed "Recommended for you" text below the name.

At the bottom, a fixed navigation bar showed four tabs: Home, Explore, Bookings, and Profile. The overall aesthetic feels calm and wellness-oriented.

Tapping a category card navigates to the service selection screen.

### Screen 2: Service Selection

The URL changed to `/service/massage`. The screen shows a back arrow, heading "What are you looking for?", and a vertical list of service cards. Four services appeared: Foot Massage (45 min, ₹250), Oil Massage (60 min, ₹300), Full Body (90 min, ₹500), and Thai Massage (60 min, ₹350).

Foot Massage had a "Recommended for you" badge. The Continue button at the bottom was disabled (grayed out).

When I tapped the Foot Massage card, it expanded with a green border to show it was selected. A new section appeared inside the card: "Choose your time window" with a dropdown showing "Select a time window".

Opening the dropdown revealed five options: Morning (9 AM – 12 PM), Afternoon (12 PM – 3 PM), Evening (3 PM – 6 PM), Night (6 PM – 9 PM), and Custom Range.

After selecting "Morning (9 AM – 12 PM)", the dropdown closed, the selection displayed in the field, and the Continue button became enabled (dark green, clickable).

### Screen 3: Price Suggestion

Navigating to `/price-suggestion`, I saw the heading "Set your price" with a prominent card showing "Recommended Price ₹300" with a sparkle icon and "High match likelihood" indicator.

Below that, an info banner stated "Price based on demand & local averages". The main controls were a slider labeled "Adjust your offer" ranging from ₹100 to ₹1000, and a text input labeled "Or enter custom amount" showing 300.

The slider and input appear to be synced. The Continue button was always enabled on this screen.

### Screen 4: Live Offers

The `/offers` screen displayed "Live Offers" with a pulsing status indicator "Offers coming in ...". Three filter buttons appeared: Price (active/filled), Rating, and Distance.

Three provider offer cards were displayed:

**Serenity Spa** - Tagged "Best Offer", showing 4.8 stars, 1.2 km away, "From ₹280". The time slot dropdown showed "2:00 PM ₹280 Best Offer" pre-selected. Opening the dropdown revealed three slots: 2:00 PM (₹280, Best Offer), 3:30 PM (₹300), 5:00 PM (₹320).

**Wellness Hub** - Tagged "Highest Rated", 4.9 stars, 0.8 km, "From ₹300". Slots: 1:00 PM (₹300), 4:00 PM (₹310).

**Tranquil Touch** - Tagged "Shortest Distance", 4.6 stars, 0.5 km, "From ₹350". Slots: 12:00 PM (₹350), 2:30 PM (₹360), 6:00 PM (₹340).

Tapping the Rating filter button reordered the cards: Wellness Hub moved to first (4.9), then Serenity Spa (4.8), then Tranquil Touch (4.6). Tapping Distance reordered by proximity: Tranquil Touch (0.5 km), Wellness Hub (0.8 km), Serenity Spa (1.2 km).

Each card has a "Book Now" button.

### Screen 5: Booking Summary

At `/booking-summary`, the heading "Booking Summary" appeared with a card showing provider details. The card displayed: Serenity Spa with star rating (★★★★☆ 4.8), Service (Foot Massage • 45 minutes), Time Slot (2:00 PM in a highlighted box, Tomorrow, Dec 20, 2024), Location (123 Wellness Street, Downtown, 1.2 km away), and Total Price (₹280) in a green-tinted section.

A "Confirm Booking" button sat at the bottom.

### Screen 6: Confirmation

The `/confirmation` screen showed a large green checkmark icon, "You're booked!" heading, and "Get ready to relax" subtext. A compact summary card displayed: Serenity Spa (4.8), Foot Massage • 45 min, Tomorrow Dec 20 / 2:00 PM, 123 Wellness Street / 1.2 km away, Total ₹280.

Three action buttons appeared: "View Booking" (primary, dark green), "Add to Calendar" (outlined, with checkmark icon), and "Directions" (outlined, with pin icon).

## Issues I Found

### Navigation tabs are non-functional

This is a behavior issue with low severity for a prototype.

Here's what's happening: The bottom navigation shows Home, Explore, Bookings, and Profile tabs. Tapping any tab highlights it but the content never changes - all tabs display the Home screen content.

What I expected to see instead: Each tab should navigate to its respective screen with relevant content.

Why this matters to users: In production, users need to access their bookings and profile.

I think this is expected for an early prototype. The likely culprit is incomplete routing in the navigation component.

### All categories show identical services

This is a content issue with low severity for a prototype.

Here's what's happening: Selecting Nails, Yoga, or Chiropractor on the home screen navigates to a service selection screen showing the same Massage services (Foot Massage, Oil Massage, Full Body, Thai Massage).

What I expected to see instead: Each category should display services relevant to that category.

Why this matters to users: The prototype doesn't demonstrate category-specific service selection.

This is placeholder data. The services list needs to be parameterized by category.

### Custom Range time option has no picker

This is a behavior issue with medium severity.

Here's what's happening: Selecting "Custom Range" from the time window dropdown simply selects it as text. No additional UI appears for specifying custom start/end times.

What I expected to see instead: A time picker or dual time inputs for defining a custom window.

Why this matters to users: Users who want times outside the predefined windows can't specify them precisely.

The likely culprit is that the Custom Range feature is not yet implemented.

## What Needs to Change

**For the UI team (ui-impl):**

The filter buttons work correctly for reordering. The time slot dropdowns per provider work well with different prices per slot. The expand/collapse on service cards is intuitive. These patterns should be preserved in implementation.

For production: implement actual navigation for bottom tabs, add category-specific service data, and build out the Custom Range time picker.

**For the API team (api-impl):**

The offers screen expects provider data with: name, rating, distance, multiple time slots each with their own price, and computed badges (Best Offer = lowest price, Highest Rated = top rating, Shortest Distance = closest).

## Accessibility Notes

**Keyboard navigation:** The prototype uses standard form controls (comboboxes, buttons) that should support keyboard interaction. Tab order follows visual flow.

**Focus and visual clarity:** Selected states use green borders. The disabled Continue button is noticeably grayed. Active filter buttons have dark fill.

**Empty and error states:** Not tested - the prototype always shows mock data.

**Mobile experience:** The layout is mobile-first. On desktop it displays centered with margins. On mobile (375px), cards stack nicely and touch targets appear adequate.

## Questions and Uncertainties

I'm not certain whether the badge logic (Best Offer, Highest Rated, Shortest Distance) should be mutually exclusive or if a single provider could have multiple badges. The prototype shows each provider with exactly one badge. Clarification needed on business rules.

## Bottom Line

Overall impact: Low
Priority: P3 (nice-to-have for prototype documentation)

This is a well-designed prototype that clearly demonstrates the core OpenSlots user journey: category → service + time → set price → view offers → book. The key UI patterns (expandable service cards, per-slot pricing dropdowns, filter-based reordering) are solid foundations for implementation. The limitations are expected for an early prototype.
