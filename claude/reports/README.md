# Reports Directory

This directory contains reports generated by various agents in the OpenSlots project. Reports are organized by agent area with consistent naming conventions.

## Report Types by Agent

### test-runner → `testing/`

**What:** Test execution summaries, coverage metrics, test health trends

**Files:**
- `testing/test-runs.md` - Running summary of all test executions with pass rates, duration, failures
- Detailed logs stored in `tests/logs/tests-YYYY-mm-dd.json` (outside this directory)

**Naming Convention:**
- Summary file: `test-runs.md` (single file, continuously updated)
- Log files: `tests/logs/tests-YYYY-mm-dd.json` (daily logs)

**When Created:** After every test run via `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:unit`, etc.

---

### ua-tester → `ui-accessibility/`

**What:** User accessibility and UI behavior test reports

**Files:**
- `ui-accessibility/YYYY-MM-DD/<slug>-test-vNNN.md`

**Naming Convention:**
- Directory: `ui-accessibility/YYYY-MM-DD/` (daily folders)
- Files: `<slug>-test-vNNN.md` where:
  - `<slug>` = Short descriptive name (e.g., `discovery-search`, `offers-filters`)
  - `vNNN` = Version number with 3 digits (e.g., `v001`, `v002`)
  - Version resets daily (first test each day is `v001`)

**Examples:**
- `ui-accessibility/2025-11-28/discovery-search-test-v001.md`
- `ui-accessibility/2025-11-28/offers-filter-behavior-test-v002.md`
- `ui-accessibility/2025-11-29/slot-card-mobile-test-v001.md` (new day, version resets)

**When Created:** After manual UI testing or accessibility review

## Future Agent Report Areas

As new reporting agents are added, create dedicated directories:

### Potential Future Areas

- **`code-reviews/`** - Code review reports (if code-review agent added)
  - Naming: `code-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD/<area>-review-vNNN.md`

- **`performance/`** - Performance test results (if perf-tester agent added)
  - Naming: `performance/YYYY-MM-DD/<benchmark>-vNNN.md`

- **`security/`** - Security audit reports (if security-auditor agent added)
  - Naming: `security/YYYY-MM-DD/<scope>-audit-vNNN.md`

- **`api-integration/`** - API integration test reports (if api-tester agent added)
  - Naming: `api-integration/YYYY-MM-DD/<endpoint>-test-vNNN.md`

---

## Naming Conventions Summary

| Agent | Directory | File Pattern | Versioning |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| test-runner | `testing/` | `test-runs.md` (single file) | Append-only |
| ua-tester | `ui-accessibility/` | `YYYY-MM-DD/<slug>-test-vNNN.md` | Daily reset |
| (future) | `<area>/` | `YYYY-MM-DD/<name>-vNNN.md` | Daily reset |

---

## General Rules

1. **Date-based organization**: Most reports use `YYYY-MM-DD/` subdirectories
2. **Daily versioning**: Version numbers reset each day (v001, v002, v003)
3. **Never overwrite**: Always increment version, never replace existing files
4. **Descriptive slugs**: Use clear, kebab-case names (e.g., `discovery-search`, `booking-flow`)
5. **Agent ownership**: Only the designated agent creates/updates files in its area

---

## Archive

`archive/` contains legacy reports that don't fit the current organization:
- Historical reviews from before agent system formalization
- One-off reports that don't fit current patterns
- Deprecated report types

Do not add new files to `archive/`. Use proper agent directories instead.
