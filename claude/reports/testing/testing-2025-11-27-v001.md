## Test Run Guidelines

### When to Run Tests

Tests should be run:

1. Before committing code - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
2. After feature implementation - Validate new features work correctly
3. After bug fixes - Ensure regression tests pass
4. In CI/CD pipeline - Automated validation on every push
5. Before deployment - Final validation before production

### Test Log File Naming

**Convention**: tests/logs/tests-YYYY-mm-dd.json

Examples:
- tests/logs/tests-2025-11-27.json
- tests/logs/tests-2025-12-15.json

Each file contains an array of test runs for that day. Multiple runs append to the same file.

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration + E2E)
pnpm test

# Run only unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
pnpm test:unit

# Run integration tests (with test database)
pnpm test:integration

# Run E2E tests (full application flow)
pnpm test:e2e

# Run tests with coverage report
pnpm test:cov

# Run tests in watch mode (development)
pnpm test:watch
```

## Notes

- This file is automatically updated by the test-runner agent after each test run
- For detailed test output, see log files in tests/logs/
- For test run context, see session files in claude/history/YYYY-MM-DD/session-XX.json
- Test failures should be addressed promptly - no failing tests should be committed
