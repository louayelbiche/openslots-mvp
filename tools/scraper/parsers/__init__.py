"""Scraper parser modules."""

# Parsers are used for extracting structured data from raw content.
# Currently, parsing logic is embedded in sources (e.g., WebsiteSource).
# This module is a placeholder for future specialized parsers:
# - html.py: HTML extraction utilities
# - menu.py: Service menu parsing
# - hours.py: Opening hours parsing
